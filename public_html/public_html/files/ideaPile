// table
particles could be different notification icons, like the bell with a "1" or an envelope or something like that
maybe make the keys different colors depending on the pitch of the plucks (through amp, I guess, idk?)

// closet

to every synth hit make the scissors make a line from one side to the other; Make sure they start from 2 specific sides only to make it fair
maybe also 2 combs swinging in different directions on the sides
for synth swings in intro make an animation of a button getting into the seam, or two tightening strings slide down
for drums it should just be round buttons zooming in and out quickly in random locations,highlighted with gray for 1s before it hits; same for the keys

//finale

intro should be clouds moving slowly but developing overtime, as the beat hits; the build up should be a move down, provided the player is given space

first drop could be waves going to the center and the closest to it gets a bit distorted; or it could be the ones on the glitchier side of it

on the buildup of the second drop it should start cornering the player in the center, then, as the drums hit, make the blocks create a landscape-like thing
    i imagine that can be done by just adding an extra layer with no repaints and a gradual color change from gray to white
    
the second drop has to be random but simple shapes, with the synth hits clearing the canvas for a second to play a quick animation of like the button  
    from last lvl spinning or a key being pressed

the outro takes the control away from user and just zooms out indefinitely until it's revealed that the dot we're moving is inside the eye of the player 
    model we've used before, but in a blank space. Then, dialogue
